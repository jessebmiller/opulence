# Opulent.Red

Let's build a Space Opera MMO Sandbox with Decentralized componenets

# Cryptoeconomic mechanism notes

- Bond curves for people to buy into versions of the game
  - What is the utility of bonded token?
    - A month's subscription?
    - In game currency? (both?)
- Token curated registries for balancing items (or anything else that needs balancing)
  - Registry curators and the development org are benefactors of the bonding curve

# Game mechanism notes

- There is an algorithmically generated universe with harvestable resources
- Everything players can do is through items (gear, resources, materials, equipment, ships, whatever)
  - Items can be used (deployed, moved, driven, activated, directed, whatever)
- All items are crafted by players from and with other items and/or resources
- There are faster than light (FTL) communication pulses that transmit players instructions to their items
  - FTL Communicators are items that enable communication (by anyone) to an area on a pulsing schedule and have a configurable pulse rate
    - This rate limits the actions per minute (APM) for play in an area
    - Players can decide how frantic or thoughtful they want the play in the areas they control FTL coms in
- Markets and trade
  - Tokenized item ownership? 0x protocol for trading?
    - The owner and operator of a state channel hub could be in a position to earn money
