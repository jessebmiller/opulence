Let's build a decentralized Space Opera MMO Sandbox 

# Game mechanism notes

## An economic base game layer (like EVE)
- There is an algorithmically generated universe with harvestable resources (that produce resource items)
- Everything players can do is through items (gear, resources, materials, equipment, ships, whatever)
  - Items can be used (deployed, moved, driven, activated, directed, shot, whatever)
  - Items can be damaged and destroyed through actions from other items/players (like being shot at and hit)
  - Items are crafted by players from and with other items
  - Items can be traded, there is an efficient marketplace

### Automation (like Factorio)
- Extraction and production can be automated (How do we scale this?)
- Automation systems can be abstracted into higher order items

### Holding costs (to encourage lean manufacturing)
- Items decay into resources, they wear out, go bad, over time
  - depending on what they are and are made of, what conditions they are in etc.
  - some may need mantinance, repair, etc.
  - some may need refrigeration, anerobic environments etc.
- There must be some operational cost associated with building a particular production system
  - possibly:
    - A tax that a central authority requires (in exchange for the rule of law, like high sec in EVE)
    - Land rent from a central authority as above
    - Risk of pirates/PVP/NPC attacks (like low sec in EVE)
    - Distance from markets (shipping cost)

## A Strategic and Tactical area control game on top (like EVE)
- Fun tactical combat
- coordination/communication/communal ownership mechanisms
- friend/foe identification and designitation
  - defensive structures that respect those designations

### Smooth transition into PVP
- a plane of high security, taxation, rent seeking, star density space
- lower security, taxation, rent seeking, star density the farther above and blow the plane you go
  - down to zero security, taxation, rent seeking and some floor star density
  - Players can travel farther out away from the center to trade risk of PVP for shipping cost and lag time to market
